Bypass Windows UAC and Windows Defender detection

Here is a series of exploits that I have made undetectable by Windows Defender to bypass the Windows UAC. These techniques are not new, but as they are, they are detected by Defender. The idea here is to make them undetectable by Windows' native antivirus through various methodologies
I will keep this document updated over time with new exploits to bypass the UAC using different methods, always with the goal of circumventing Windows Defender detection

You can find a detailed article on Medium outlining this process with the Fodhelper exploit :
